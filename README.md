# Url Shortener

This is just a code repository to train some Software Engineer skills.

The logic to create the URL shortener probably is not the best one, but I'm not concerned about it at this first moment.


# Running the project

## API

After cloning the project, navigate to the folder `src/api`. Creates a copy of the file `local.env.default` and rename the copied file to `local.env`. Fulfill the variables inside it with your local values. Maybe will be there some default values, if they don't match your local environment settings, you can change those values to match your environment.
